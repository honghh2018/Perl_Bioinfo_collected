Dear submitter,

It appears that you are trying to submit to GEO, but you have already uploaded
raw data to SRA. You do not have to resubmit the raw data to GEO, but you will
have to upload a metadata template and processed data files to GEO. Please use
the instructions appended below. You will need to include the SRA accessions
in your GEO submission.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
The GEO Team

Instructions for submitting sequencing data to GEO are here:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html

You do not need to re-submit the raw data files. Instead, please include
additional 
information in the Metadata template
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/examples/seq_template_v2.1.xls) as follows:

[1] Reference the SRA Study accession (SRPnnnn) and BioProject accession
(PRJNAnnnn) in the SERIES 'Overall design' field.

[2] In the 'raw file' column of the SAMPLES section, please list the
corresponding SRA Experiment accessions (SRXnnnnnn) so that we can create the
appropriate links between the SRA Experiments and GEO Samples.

[3] Add a 'BioSample' column to the SAMPLES section and include the
corresponding BioSample accessions (SAMNnnnnnn).

[4] Add an 'instrument model' column to the SAMPLES section and indicate the
instrument model that was used for sequencing.

You do not need to fill in the 'RAW FILES' or 'PAIRED-END EXPERIMENTS' sections.

Please upload the Metadata template and processed data files to GEO.
FTP instructions for depositing sequencing data to GEO are here:

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance. 

We look forward to receiving your upload notification.

Regards,
The GEO Team
