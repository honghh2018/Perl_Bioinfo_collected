WGCNA analysis needed two important files.All gene FPKM matrix file with certain samples must be given.sample trait matrix with every samples
for example,trait file:  no biorepeat
sampleID T01 T02 T03 T04 T05 T06
T01      1    0   0   0   0    0
T02      0    1   0   0   0    0
T03      0    0   1   0   0    0
T04      0    0   0   1   0    0
T05      0    0   0   0    1   0
T06      0    0   0   0    0   1

if need biorepeat:T01,T02,T03 and T04,T05ï¼ŒT06 considering a group of three biorepeat
sampleID T01_T02_T03 T04_T05_T06
T01           1          0
T02           1          0 
T03           1          0
T04           0          1
T05           0          1
T06           0          1

if you have the trait related data,just input it 

use perl scriptes invoking the R WGCNA packages to analyize the data.
if you no the scripte,you can step by step to use R packages(WGCNA) to analyize.
