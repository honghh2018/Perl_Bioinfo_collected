Wizard of submission for TSA:
Fristly, submitting original data from SRA portal to get the project accession,sample accession and the SRRxxx accessions.
secondly,it start to upload sequences of assembly to TSA from TSA portal.
first of all,the following files must be downloaded at the first time.
https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structcomment/nongenomes/ download   assembly.cmt
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/template.cgi download  template.sbt
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools/converters/by_program/tbl2asn/ download the latest version for command-line that generated 
.sqn file. 64 must be better. Please try linux64.tbl2asn --help to look for helps.
what's more significant, you should upload your fa file at step 3 that chose fasta button of TSA. Afterward, in the light of the error for 
NCBI provided to filter the wrong sequence using perl scrits. The error included adapter/N-ends/contamination sequence and trim sequences.
.the step of this error indicated you should note was the order across NCBI's error provided.firstly the error of adapter and N-ends
must be token place in the first place.when it achieved, next step for information filled and submission.
As all above work done,the status of projection submitted accession was showed at the table,if its Queued meant mid processing.
when errors happens again,it would show the contamination gene sequence too.you should filter the error gene identity and 
push the button 'fix submission' to upload again, until all those finished 

In addtion, copy the fasta file that you were going to submit to TSA to the directory.
execute the command linux64.tbl2asn -t template.sbt -i Citrus_limon_filter1.fa -w assembly.cmt -M t -n "Citrus limon" in your linux
 terminal bash to generate the .sqn file to submit.
 comment:the error must be identify with software linux64.tbl2asn running over.
 
 when all mission above finished,you should try TSA portal to step three that selected ASN file to submit the sqn file.
