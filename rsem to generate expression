By and large, gene expression can be generated by DESeq2 or EBseq. incidentally DESeq2 refered to repeat samples,by contrary, EBSeq
non-repeated.nevertheless, what if you want to calculte expression from specific sample with reference of Unigene fa file, the 
rsem software shoud be used.

Initially, installing rsem befor you should install bowtie first.and then type below command to install rsem:
git clone git@github.com:bli25ucb/RSEM_tutorial.git ./
unzip bowtie2-2.2.6-source.zip
cd bowtie2-2.2.6
make -j 8
cd ..
tar -xzf RSEM-1.2.25.tar.gz
cd RSEM-1.2.25
make -j 8
make ebseq
cd ..
